h1, h2, p {
                
    text-align: center;
}

/*
Step 18

The text is centered again so the link to the CSS file is working. Add another style to the file that changes the 
background-color property to brown for the body element.

*/

body {
    /*
    background-color: burlywood;
    */
  }

/*
Step 21

The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this. Create 
a new type selector in the style sheet that gives your div element a width of 300px.

Step 23
Now use the existing div selector to set the background color of the div element to be burlywood.

Step 24
Now it's easy to see that the text is centered inside the div element. Currently, the width of the div element is specified 
in pixels (px). Change the width property's value to be 80%, to make it 80% the width of its parent element (body).

Step 25

Next, you want to center the div horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. 
Think of the margin as invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the div element within the 
body element.

/*
div {
    /* width: 300px;
    width: 80%;
    background-color: burlywood;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    }
*/

/*
Step 26
So far you have been using type selectors to style elements. A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in 
front of it, like this:

.class-name {
  styles
}
Change the existing div selector into a class selector by replacing div with a class named menu.

*/

.menu {
    /* width: 300px; */
    width: 80%;
    background-color: burlywood;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    
}
