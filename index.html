        Step 16
        Now you need to link the styles.css file so the styles will be applied again. Nest a self-closing link element in the 
        head element. Give it a rel attribute value stylesheet and an href attribute value of styles.css.

        Step 17
        For the styling of the page to look similar on mobile as it does on a desktop or laptop, you need to add a meta 
        element with a special content attribute. Add the following within the head element:

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

        -->
        <link rel = stylesheet href = styles.css>        
        <title>Cafe Menu</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

        <!--
        <style>
            /*    
            h1  {
                text-align: center;
                }
            h2  {
                text-align: center;
                }
            p   {
                text-align: center;
                }
            */
            /*
            Step 13
            You now have three type selectors with the exact same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many 
            elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:
            
            selector1, selector2 {
                property: value;
            }
            Delete the three existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that centers the text for the 
            h1, h2, and p elements.
            */

            h1, h2, p {
                
                text-align: center;
            }
            /*
            Step 14
            You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more 
            styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.
            We have created a separate styles.css file for you and switched the editor view to that file. You can change 
            between files with the tabs at the top of the editor. Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the 
            styles.css file. Make sure to exclude the opening and closing style tags.
            
            Step 15
            Now that you have the CSS in the styles.css file, go ahead and remove the style element and all its content. Once 
            it is removed, the text that was centered will shift back to the left.

        Step 20
        The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add 
        a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div.
